Changelog

1.1.0
  a) Changed representation of the board from two separate data structures to one. This made it possible to implement another feature as well.
  b) Implemented detection of monsters and treasures when one tile away. 
  c) Implemented health bars for both the player and the enemies.
  d) Added the speed stat. Both player and enemies now have speed, which determines who will land an attack first. Increasing speed, either through level up or items, remains unimplemented.
  e) Added level up message.
